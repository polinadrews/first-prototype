      The task
      </h1>

      <p>You need to design an online service where a user can register a personal drone with their
        licence (you will not be designing the licence application - assume this already exists).</p>

      <p>As the legislation requires that the government records certain information,
        we will need to capture the:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>date the application was made</li>
          <li>licence ID number of the licence holder</li>
          <li>licence holderâ€™s name, date of birth and home address</li>
          <li>address where the drone is stored</li>
          <li>make and model of the drone</li>
        </ul>
