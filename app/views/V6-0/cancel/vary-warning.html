   <p>
         If you have submitted an application but now need a different type of permission, you can <a href="#" class="govuk-link">vary your application</a> instead of cancelling it. </p>
<p>Your current permission will continue while you vary your application.</p>

           <p>  To vary your application you must:

                       <li> have already submitted an application but not yet received a decision</li>
                       <li>submit a new application for the permission you need and pay the applicable fees </li>

                       </ul>
</p>
                       <p>  When we receive your new application, we will:
                                 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--">
                                   <li> send you a confirmation email</li>
                                   <li> refund your previous application fee if you have not already provided biometrics </li>
                   <li> refund your previous immigration health surcharge if you paid it   </li>
