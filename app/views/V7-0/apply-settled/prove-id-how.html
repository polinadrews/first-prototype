      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">How you prove your identity</h1>

      <p>To help us confirm your identity and nationality, we need to check your identity document.</p>

      <p>You can:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>use the 'EU Exit: ID Document Check' iPhone app or Android app on your phone or someone else's</li>
        <li>book an appointment to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/id-scan-eu-settlement-scheme" target="_blank">scan your identity document in person</a></li>
        <li>enter your document details online and send your identity document by post</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you send your identity document by post, we will return it by Royal Mail Signed For 2nd Class delivery.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After your identity document has been checked</h2>

      <p>Using details from your identity document, we will create your UK Visas and Immigration account and send you a code to access it.</p>

      <p>You will need to sign in to complete your application.</p>

      <p>If your application is successful, you can use your account to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status" target="_blank">view and prove your immigration status</a>.</p>

      <p>You can complete your application on a computer or any device.</p>
