      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prove your identity</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">This will be the first step in the application. You will need an email address and a phone number.</p>

        {{ govukWarningText({

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You will also need your passport or national identity card.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are not in the UK, your national identity card must have a biometric chip.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Check which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">countries are in the European Economic Area (EEA)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are not an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you are in the UK, you will need to use one of the following:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>passport</li>
          <li>biometric residence card</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you are not in the UK, you can only use your biometric residence card.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use your personal information</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The Home Office will use the personal information you provide to decide whether to grant your application.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In addition to an identity check, the three main ways in which your personal information will be processed are:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>criminality and security checks;</li>
            <li>if you have provided your National Insurance number, real time checks with the Department for Work and Pensions and
              HM Revenue and Customs to consider evidence of your residence in the UK (for example tax or benefit records); and</li>
              <li>on a case by case basis, sharing information with other organisations to verify evidence you have provided within
                your application to protect against fraud and the use of counterfeit documents (for example verifying with a university
                that the university certificate you have provided is genuine)</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">This data sharing is designed to help applicants evidence their status in a quick and straightforward way by using data already held by other Government departments.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The Home Office may also, on a case by case basis, process your information in other ways in order to fulfil its legal and official functions. This could include, for example:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if, in the future, you apply for UK citizenship;</li>
          <li>if we find evidence a significant crime has been committed;</li>
            <li>if we discover an immigration offence (like a sham marriage) is being committed; or</li>
            <li>to allow the Home Office to carry out its safeguarding duties</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="govuk-body">This is set out in more detail in
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-information-use-in-borders-immigration-and-citizenship">the Borders, Immigration and Citizenship System privacy information notice</a>.
          The BICS privacy information notice also sets out how you can request a copy of your personal information, and how you can complain.
          You should be aware that the information set out in this note is intended to supplement the BICS privacy information notice, not to replace it.</p>
